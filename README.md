# Lab
Welcome to Lab repository !

The examples you will find are intended as simple setups for building POCs (proof of concept) or testing proper configuration of our devices.
They are not created and/or designed for production environments.


So let's get started!

## How the lab is organized
You will find a README.md file inside each project folder with all information you need.


## Docker & Compose
Almost all examples use docker to keep the host clean, to install it follow the official documentation.
